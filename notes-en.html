        #Using Scratch

        Scratch is a great tool for teaching coding concepts, and building fun and creative digital games. If you aren’t familiar with the program: great news! There are tons of free, online resources to get you started. Here are a few that we think are awesome:

        * Scratch <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/educators/#resources">Educator Resources</a> (especially the <a href="https://cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__0c1805349a6fe15c01c668d3f8acd971__/pdfs/help/Getting-Started-Guide-Scratch2.pdf">Getting Started Guide</a>)
        * Google CS First <a href="https://www.cs-first.com/training/introduction-computer-science-and-scratch">Training Materials</a>
        * Teachers Learning Code <a href="https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/wp-content/uploads/teacher-quick-start-guide.pdf">Guide</a>

        #Introduction

        ##Kick-Off Script

        Welcome to our Girls Learning Code workshop: Animating with Scratch! We’re so glad that you could be here today and hope you’re ready to learn lots of new things.

        How many of you have been to one of our workshops or camps before?
        (If you get some hands up, ask a few of them what workshops they attended)

        We started running our first programs for kids with Girls Learning Code workshops and camps back in 2012, and then since we had so many people asking if boys could come too we started Kids Learning Code a year later in 2013. Since then, we’ve expanded to over 30 cities across Canada and have taught over 19,000 kids how to code!

        Before we get started with our workshop, there are a few things we need to go over:

        * <strong>Washrooms:</strong> Can everyone please point in the direction of the washrooms? (clarify where they are located) If you need to go to the washroom, please bring a buddy with you.
        * <strong>Water:</strong> If you brought a water bottle with you, you’re welcome to keep it on your desk, but make sure to keep the lid closed when you’re not using it. If you don’t have a water bottle, one of our mentors can help grab a glass from the kitchen later on (but please keep glasses away from laptops).
        * <strong>Break/snacks:</strong> We’ll have a 10 minute break when you can eat any snacks you brought with you or just stretch your legs. If you have a (peanut free) snack, please eat it out front and clean up any crumbs or wrappers when you’re done.


        ##Intro Slides

        ![notes](framework/img/workshop/animating-notes.png)
        <!--![notes-glcday](framework/img/workshop/glcday-notes.png)-->

        <br>
        #Code-Along

        * Open up Scratch, and click on “create” (top, left corner).
        * Point out the main elements: Stage, Sprites, and Scripts. Demonstrate how to drag and connect blocks.
        * Give learners a few minutes to click on blocks and explore.
        * Go through 2-4 challenges with the group, where learners are tasked with trying to make something happen in Scratch. For example, “Try to make Scratch the cat move” or “Try to make Scratch the cat say something when the space key is pressed” (See <a href="http://bit.ly/scratch-challenge-solutions-doc">Code-Along Challenges</a> for more examples and solutions)
        * After 5 minutes on a challenge, have a volunteer come to the front and show how they solved the challenge. Point out that there are many different ways to approach these challenges, and multiple solutions. Ask if anyone solved it in a different way.
        * If time, ask learners to think of challenges for the group.
        * This is a great time to address common bugs and questions that arise, e.g. how to delete a sprite, what to do when a sprite has walked off of the screen, etc.

        <br>
        #Work Session

        * Choose 1-2 activities from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13vVx3XwkvJuRs2ca2GVvLuixVlIkXkzbRYdzA14aOi8/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a> (Animating tab). Suggested activity for 6-9 year olds: Stormy Night. Suggested activities for 9-13 year olds: Bedtime Story and Rainy Day.
        * Show learners where to find the <strong>starter project</strong> in the Scratch class.
        * Follow the <strong>solution sheet</strong> as you lead the group in creating a working foundation, stopping right before the “Add-On” portion.
        * Give time for learners to remix the project on their own. It might be helpful to brainstorm remix ideas for inspiration (refer to “Add-On” ideas).
        * Make sure everyone clicks on "SHARE" when they are finished (top, right corner)
        * Have learners add their projects to the studio (Go to "My Class" > Select studio > Add Projects).
        * Leave time at the end for learners to test their games and share their projects with each other. If short on time: Have a Gallery Walk, where learners open the project on their screens, tuck in their chairs, and walk around to see each other's work.


        <br>

        #Unplugged Activity (Optional)

        If you notice that the group is needing a break, give them 10 minutes to use the washroom, get some water, or grab a snack from their bags. Another option is to run an unplugged activity midway through the workshop to get them out of their seats and moving around. Unplugged activities usually take around 10 minutes to run. Choose an unplugged activity from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tUTiHl7scs8RHdLLvdmZTFtD9EuAyZhetTLFgvar5CQ/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>. Suggested activity: Do The Robot.

        <br>
        #Closing Script

        Who can tell me something new they learned today? (<strong>*Refer to slide 29 for examples!*</strong> If you don’t get any hands up, you can either ask a specific kid that was definitely engaged during the workshop, or review a couple of the key lessons in the workshop)

        You all did an amazing job and we’re really impressed with how great your projects turned out.

        If you want to learn more about coding, design, and technology, go onto our site girlslearningcode.com to check out all of our upcoming workshops and join our mailing list. (Announce next workshop and give short description).

        Before we go, let’s give our mentors a big hand!

        Thanks and we hope to see you all in another workshop soon!
